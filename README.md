# LED-Matrix-Simulator
Used to simulate a Scroll pHAT HD but can be adapted for other uses.

I was too impatient waiting for my [Scroll pHAT HD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd) to arrive so I created a simulator for it.

It is also useful to see what things will look like on it without writing any code.
